  "The conflict score is calculated by breaking each paragraph down into sentences. Every sentence gets a computed 'negativity' and 'intensity' score, and then this is averaged to give each paragraph a conflict score, with the idea being the more negative and intense the emotions in a paragraph are, the higher the conflict is. A higher score == more conflict.";
