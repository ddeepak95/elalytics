    "paragraphText": "He was a good husband, a good father. I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t believe in it. I don\u2019t believe that it happened. I saw it happen but it isn\u2019t true. It can\u2019t be. He was always gentle. If you\u2019d have seen him playing with the children, anybody who saw him with the children would have known that there wasn\u2019t any bad in him, not one mean bone. When I first met him he was still living with his mother, over near Spring Lake, and I used to see them together, the mother and the sons, and think that any young fellow that was that nice with his family must be one worth knowing. Then one time when I was walking in the woods I met him by himself coming back from a hunting trip. He hadn\u2019t got any game at all, not so much as a field mouse, but he wasn\u2019t cast down about it. He was just larking along enjoying the morning air. That\u2019s one of the things I first loved about him. He didn\u2019t take things hard, he didn\u2019t grouch and whine when things didn\u2019t go his way. So we got to talking that day. And I guess things moved right along after that, because pretty soon he was over here pretty near all the time. And my sister said \u2014 see, my parents had moved out the year before and gone south, leaving us the place \u2014 my sister said, kind of teasing but serious, \u201cWell! If he\u2019s going to be here every day and half the night, I guess there isn\u2019t room for me!\u201d And she moved out \u2014 just down the way. We\u2019ve always been real close, her and me. That\u2019s the sort of thing doesn\u2019t ever change. I couldn\u2019t ever have got through this bad time without my sis.   "

    "paragraphText": "Well, so he come to live here. And all I can say is, it was the happiest year of my life. He was just purely good to me. A hard worker and never lazy, and so big and fine\u2010looking. Everybody looked up to him, you know, young as he was. Lodge Meeting nights, more and more often they had him to lead the singing. He had such a beautiful voice, and he\u2019d lead off strong, and the others following and joining in, high voices and low. It brings the shivers on me now to think of it, hearing it, nights when I\u2019d stayed home from meeting when the children was babies \u2014 the singing coming up through the trees there, and the moonlight, summer nights, the full moon shining. I\u2019ll never hear anything so beautiful. I\u2019ll never know a joy like that again. "

    "paragraphText": "It was the moon, that\u2019s what they say. It\u2019s the moon\u2019s fault, and the blood. It was in his father\u2019s blood. I never knew his father, and now I wonder what become of him. He was from up Whitewater way, and had no kin around here. I always thought he went back there, but now I don\u2019t know. There was some talk about him, tales that come out after what happened to my husband. It\u2019s something runs in the blood, they say, and it may never come out, but if it does, it\u2019s the change of the moon that does it. Always it happens in the dark of the moon, when everybody\u2019s home and asleep. Something comes over the one that\u2019s got the curse in his blood, they say, and he gets up because he can\u2019t sleep, and goes out into the glaring sun, and goes off all alone \u2014 drawn to find those like him.

I\u2019d half rouse and say, \u201cWhere you going to?\u201d and he\u2019d say, \u201cOh, hunting, be back this evening,\u201d and it wasn\u2019t like him, even his voice was different. But I\u2019d be so sleepy, and not wanting to wake the kids, and he was so good and responsible, it was no call of mine to go asking \u201cWhy?\u201d and \u201cWhere?\u201d and all like that. So it happened that way maybe three times or four. He\u2019d come back late and worn out, and pretty near cross for one so sweet\u2010tempered \u2014 not wanting to talk about it.  I figured everybody got to bust out now and then, and nagging never helped anything.  But it did begin to worry me.  Not so much that he went, but that he come back so tired and strange. Even, he smelled strange. It made my hair stand up on end. I could not endure it and I said, \u201cWhat is that \u2014 those smells on you? All over you!\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d real short, and made like he was sleeping. But he went down when he thought I wasn\u2019t noticing, and washed and washed himself. But those smells stayed in his hair, and in our bed, for days. "

Our youngest, the little one, my baby, she turned from her father. Just overnight. He come in and she got scared\u2010looking, stiff, with her eyes wide, and then she begun to cry and try to hide behind me.

I heard a little stir in the passage, when I listened. So I got up, because I could bear it no longer. I went out into the passage, and it was light there, hard sunlight coming in from the door. And I saw him standing just outside, in the tall grass by the entrance. His head was hanging. Presently he sat down, like he felt weary, and looked down at his feet. I held still, inside, and watched \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what for. "

But it picked up a heavy fallen tree branch in its long white foot, and shoved the end of that down into our house, at me. I snapped the end of it in my teeth and started to force my way out, because I knew the man would kill our children if it could. But my sister was already coming. I saw her running at the man with her head low and her mane high and her eyes yellow as the winter sun. It turned on her and raised up that branch to hit her. But I come out of the doorway, mad with the mother anger, and the others all were coming answering my call, the whole pack gathering, there in that blind glare and heat of the sun at noon. "

I got there and it was dead. The others were drawing back from the kill, because of the taste of the blood, and the smell. The younger ones were cowering and some crying, and my sister rubbed her mouth against her fore legs over and over to get rid of the taste. I went up close because I thought if the thing was dead the spell, the curse must be done, and my husband could come back \u2014 alive, or even dead, if I could only see him, my true love, in his true form, beautiful. But only the dead man lay there white and bloody. We drew back and back from it, and turned and ran back up into the hills, back to the woods of the shadows and the twilight and the blessed dark."
